#The following is the script for build the requested plots

# The subsetted dataframe is called "analysisDate2"


#Plot 2

# my plot has a little error, it prints "ju", "vi", "sรก" instead
# instead of "Thru", "Fri", Sat" because the system language of my computer
# is spanish but the day names are correct
